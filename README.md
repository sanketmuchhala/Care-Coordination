# Care-Coordination
Every citizen's right to quality healthcare treatment should not depend on their location. The
financial pressure faced by the rural hospitals is acting as a
hindrance to this purpose. With different visualizations of our project,
we aim to tackle this problem and study the patterns
encompassing geographical variation and Medicare payment differences between rural and urban regions. The data provided
by CMS gives the real-time negotiated rates and completeness
of all the medical procedures. The objective is to study and gain
insights into the healthcare system differences between rural and
urban regions using the plethora of information available through
CMS and other government datasets.

# Approach

We intend to analyze the
issue by creating various visualizations for interactively understanding the
the financial health of rural hospital systems. We generated choropleth maps,
box and whisker plots and histograms for comparing how structural
limitations of low patient counts affect financial health. We also explore
visualizations on how hospital conversions from full hospitals to referral
centers or emergency hospitals can help save these critically important
health centers.

# Conclusion

We have tried to highlight a structural problem affecting Rural
American Healthcare Systems through a series of data visualizations. We
have understood how federal support is structurally limited to rural areas
due to fewer beneficiaries.
